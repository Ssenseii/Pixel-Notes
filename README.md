# Things I learned: 

- Use PNGs instead of SVGs with Pixel Art both in figma and on the web. (Performance boost)
- Customizing Scrollbars (though not apparent since I opted for noscrollbar)
- Checkboxes don't take background-image.
- HTMLLabel property: "htmlFor" needs an id.



## Ideas

- Stress button functionality with title div
- Animations
- top left notifications
